      <h2>About Me.</h2>
      <p>
        In 2023, I uncovered my passion for software engineering while seeking
        out new career opportunities. This newfound interest allowed me to
        immerse myself to delve into the world of coding, and explore various
        programming languages and frameworks.

        After months later of self-teaching, I decided to join a bootcamp. This
        provided me with structured learning and hands on experience to help me
        to continuously develop and evolve as a full-stack developer. This
        intensive program not only solidified my technical foundation but also
        enhanced my problem-solving abilities and prepared me for real-world
        challenges in the tech industry.

      <p>
        With a passion for enhancing user interaction through front-end
        engineering, Iâ€™m keen to connect with peers who have shared interests
        and explore new opportunities I can where I can both add value and
        further my career.

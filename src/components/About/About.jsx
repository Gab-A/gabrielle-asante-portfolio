          In 2023, I uncovered my passion for software engineering while seeking

          immerse myself to delve into the world of coding.

          After months later of self-teaching, I decided to join a bootcamp.
          This provided me with structured learning and hands on experience
          which helped me to continuously develop and evolve as a full-stack
          developer. This intensive program not only solidified my technical
          foundation but also enhanced my problem-solving abilities and prepared
          me for real-world challenges in the tech industry.

          With an enthusiasm for enhancing user interaction through front-end
          development, I&#39;m keen to connect with peers who have shared
          interests and excited to explore new opportunities where I can both
          add value and further my career.
